'euler321_I2B_12B_with_contracts_EUL003_SLDV' is partially compatible for property proving with Simulink Design Verifier.

The model can be analyzed by Simulink Design Verifier. 
It contains unsupported elements that will be stubbed out during analysis. The results of the analysis might be incomplete.
